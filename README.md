# PETGNNs

PPFGNN is a Graph Neural framework designed to perform federated learning while preserving privacy. This project integrates various privacy-preserving technologies such as Differential Privacy, Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC), Private Set Intersection (PSI), Homomorphic Encryption, and Sharding to ensure data confidentiality during collaborative training. PPFGNN is ideal for applications in fake news detection and fraud detection.

## Problem & Solution

Imagine two organizations, Org A and Org B, both want to train a model to detect fake news. Org A has a dataset collected from social media, and Org B has a dataset from news websites. However, both organizations are concerned about sharing their sensitive data due to privacy issues.

Solution: PPFGNN

With PPFGNN, Org A and Org B can train a shared model without exposing their datasets to each other. Here's how it works:

- Create a Project:

  - Org A creates a new project in the PPFGNN UI for fake news detection and invites Org B to collaborate.
- Upload Datasets:

  - Both Org A and Org B upload their datasets to the PPFGNN system. The data remains encrypted and secure throughout the process.

- Configure Privacy Settings:
  - They configure the privacy settings to ensure their data is protected using techniques like Differential Privacy and SMPC.
- Start Training:
  - They start the federated training process. The model is trained on the combined knowledge from both datasets without either organization accessing the other's raw data.
- Monitor and Improve:
  - Throughout the training, both organizations can monitor the modelâ€™s performance through the PPFGNN UI and make adjustments as needed.
- Incremental Updates:

  - If Org A collects new data, they can incrementally update the model without retraining from scratch, ensuring the model stays up-to-date.
- Decremental Learning:

  - If Org B discovers some of their data is faulty or no longer relevant, they can use decremental learning techniques to remove the influence of that data from the model.
    
This way, both organizations benefit from a robust and accurate model without compromising their data privacy.

## TikToks PETAce

I utilized TikTok's PETAce for a lot of the encryption covered in the project.
I used TikTok's [PETAce-Solo](https://github.com/tiktok-privacy-innovation/PETAce-Solo) for hashing and partial homomorphic encryption. I wrote CPP wrapper functions to get the outcomes.
I used the PETAce's [Python API](https://github.com/tiktok-privacy-innovation/PETAce/tree/main/python) for secureNumpy and SETOPS(PSI) support.
